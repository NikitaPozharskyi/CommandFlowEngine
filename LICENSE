âœ… **Things to customize easily:**
- **Repo name:** `CommandFlowEngine`
- **Package install instruction:** (leave it as a placeholder until you publish)
- **Code snippets:** replace `RequestHandler` and `IStateStore` names if your actual code uses different terms.

Do you want me to **add diagrams** or draft a **Contributing Guide section** too?
